		<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Rock and roll is a genre of music that originated from Cleveland, Ohio in the late 1940s and peaked in popularity in the 1950s, characterized by a heavy beat and simple melodies. It was formed from Black music genres including jazz, R&#38;B (Rhythm and Blues), gospel, and country, with a strong emphasis on lyrics. Rock and roll was usually played with a twelve-bar structure whose instrumentation included guitar, bass, and drums. The term "rock and roll" originated as an African-American slang term for sexual intercourse and a lot of rock and roll songs were about sex, drinking, and drugs. In the 1960s, rock and roll was fragmented into many sub-genres that are simply known as rock in the modern day.

		<h3>Controversy</h3>
		<p>Much of the older generation strongly disliked the introduction of rock and roll. There were many reasons for this belief, the most notable of which is that it further motivated the younger generations to rebel against authority due to its aggressive nature and contentious lyrics. Whites in the middle and upper classes thought that the music was tasteless, considering that it came from a segregated ethnic group that at the time was seen as inferior. Despite creating many arguments between different races, the surge of rock and roll in the 1950s reduced racial segregation and helped unify Black and white cultures.</p>

			<h3>Racial Impacts</h3>
			<p>With rock and roll being integrated into mainstream culture in the 1950s, white artists started making covers of Black songs, though most attempts were unsuccessful until the rise of Elvis Presley in 1953. Elvis was extremely successful due to catering to what the masses wanted - the face of a handsome white man representing the genre of rock and roll. Elvis covered many famous rock and roll songs, including Jailhouse Rock and Hound Dog, earning him the title "King of rock and roll". Due to the popularity of the genre and the fact that rock and roll originated from Black culture, the massive surge of popularity brought a lot of recognition to Black artists as well, including Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Ray Charles.</p>

			<p>The radio provided another platform for rock and roll to reach out to new audiences. The music originating from Black culture spread all around America, and both Black and white artists were performing together around the country. Teenagers were getting into the genre no matter the race of the singer, bringing the cultures together in the younger generation. The lyrics of the songs also advocated for racial equality, so those that listened to rock and roll were more aware about discrimination against Black culture. Although the history of the genre saw many racial inequalities, its permanent impact of a larger population being aware of Black oppression left a positive mark.</p>

		<h3>Fragmentation</h3>
		<p>By the late 1950s, most rock and roll artists gave up on pursuing the genre and the music became more sophisticated. Through the 1960s, many subgenres of rock and roll were created&mdash;with the collection of these genres being known as rock in the modern day. Though rock and roll is rarely played in the twenty-first century, its legacy in music and in raising awareness against Black discrimination lives on.</p>
